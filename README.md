# sounion
Project for converting image to sound and vice versa in a useful manner.

Sound -> Image: for vision impaired. Determine depth/color/identity of objects through hearing.
Image -> Sound: for encryption/storage of sounds in an image. Can transfer sound snippets through
  photography and create visual images.

Whatever else the conversion process can do...
